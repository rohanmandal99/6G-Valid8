# 6G-Valid8 Roadmap 🗺️

**Project Vision:**  
An AI-assisted validation and triage platform for 6G software-defined testbeds.  
Goal → reduce wireless validation cycle time by some fraction using intelligent log parsing, anomaly detection, and root-cause tracing.

---

## 📅 Phase 0 — Setup & Bootstrap 
- ✅ Repo scaffolding, venv, FastAPI backend, CI prep

## 🚀 Phase 1 — Log Parser & Persistence 
- Build log ingestion API (upload, parse, store)
- Regex + NLP-based event extraction
- JSON schema for test results

## 🧠 Phase 2 — AI-Assisted Metrics Engine 
- LLM-powered triage suggestions
- KPI correlation, trend summaries
- Auto-report generation (PDF/Markdown)

## 🔬 Phase 3 — Orchestrator + Triage Intelligence 
- Integrate with OAI / simulated 6G stack
- Anomaly classification using embeddings
- Rule-based test triggers

## 💻 Phase 4 — Frontend UI & CI/CD 
- React/Tailwind dashboard for logs & analytics
- GitHub Actions + auto-deploy to cloud
- Beta release to early testers 

---

## 🛠️ Key Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Pandas, Regex, OpenAI API (later)
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind, Plotly/Recharts
- **AI/ML:** scikit-learn, LangChain, Transformers
- **Infra:** Docker, GitHub Actions, optional Cloud Run

---

## 🧭 Long-term Goals
- CI-ready test harness integration
- Support for OAI, srsRAN, and custom PHY/MAC stacks
- Plug-and-play data pipeline for real devices
- AI-based anomaly clustering (6G validation twin)
